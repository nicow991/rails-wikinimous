# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end
require "faker"
# TODO: Write a seed to insert 100 articles in the database
10.times do
  article = Article.create(title: Faker::Music.band, content: Faker::Quote.famous_last_words)
  article.save!
end
